% Light emitting diodes (LED) are widely used light producing electrical components.
% % The production of such devices .... smt nanotechnology?
% In this rapport, a premade multi-layered semiconductor wafer is used to produce LEDs.
% The wafer have been processed by strategically using photolithography, deposition, and etching.
% The LED have been characterized using an optical microscope, a scanning electron microscope, a profilometer, an ellipsometer and a SourceMeter.
% Measurements of the IV-characteristics of the LEDs have been performed, which confirmed that the LEDs are working as a diode, and they are emitting light.
% With voltage at 1.7 V and current at 30 mA the LEDs emits red light, which is the around the target wavelength of 675 nm.


% This is the conclusion
Functioning LEDs have been produced by using a multi-layered semiconductor wafer.
The wafer have been processed by strategically using photolithography, deposition, and etching.
Characterization of the LEDs have been performed and the results show that the LEDs are working as a diode.
With voltage at 1.7 V and current at 30 mA the LEDs emits red light, which is the around the target wavelength of 675 nm.
