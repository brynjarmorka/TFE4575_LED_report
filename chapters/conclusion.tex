% This is the conclusion
Functioning LEDs have been produced by using a multi-layered semiconductor wafer.
The wafer have been processed by strategically using photolithography, deposition, and etching.
Producing the LEDs did not always go as planned, and some defects and artifacts were produced.
However, characterization of the LEDs have been performed and the results show that the LEDs are working as a diode.
With voltage at 1.7 V and current at 30 mA the LEDs emits red light, which is the around the target wavelength of 675 nm.
