% INTRODUCTION

LEDs are important nanotechnology products, which is why making a LED was the lab task in TFE4575.
While doing this lab the students used many nanotechnology techniques to produce a LED from a metal stack.
Lithography, etching, deposition, characterization, and more were used to produce a LED.
These techniques should be familiar for the nanotechnology students specializing in nanoelectronics at NTNU, and is why they were chosen for this lab.
As stated in the introduction lecture, doing photolithography requires training with failing to be able to do it correctly.
In almost every single lab session, the students managed to fuck up a big or a small step, resulting in a lot of learning and redoing.
However, the students managed to produce a working LED in the end, and the lab was a great success.
The LED will be sold to the highest bidder, or be used as the star in Thords Christmas tree.
Merry Christmas, we hope you enjoy the read!
