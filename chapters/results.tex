\subsection{Photoresist Profile}

\autoref{fig:undercut} shows an SEM image of the photoresit profile of the dose test sample where undercut was most visible.
This is the sample with a dose of 1300 mJ/cm$^2$ and 5 minutes developing time.
The depth of the undercut, i.e. the difference between the top and bottom of the profile, is estimated to be roughly 1 \textmu m.

\autoref{fig:undercut_bot} and \autoref{fig:undercut_top} show 100X magnification images of one LED where the focus is on the bottom and the top of the profile, respectively.
This shows that the bottom area of the finger is smaller than the top area, again verifying that an undercut profile is obtained with a dose of 1300 mJ/cm$^2$ and 5 minutes developing time.

\subsection{Etching}

% profilometer on GaAs etch
The GaAs wet etch of the dummy was done for 45 seconds and gave a depth of 50 nm, thus the etching of the LED was done for twice as long at 90 seconds and gave a depth of 100 nm.
This is an etch rate of 1.11 nm/s.
The measured height of two fingers using the profilometer is shown in \autoref{fig:profilometer_GaAs_100nm_etch}.
The other measurements of the fingers gave similar results.
Before the etch the Au fingers was measured to be 250 nm high.
In the figure it is possible to see the etch edge, which is marked with the green line at 100 nm. 
The second green line is at 350 nm, which is the height of the finger after the etch.
A profilometer artifact is shown in \autoref{fig:Dummy_GaAs_80nm_etch_lost_contact}.

        The etch depth here was 80 nm, which was deeper that around the fingers. 
        However, this plot shows an artifact in the profilometer, which is the curve starting at around 550 \textmu m.
        The upwards curve continues upwards outside the plot till 350 nm, which is higher than the finger height.
    }

\end{figure}


% profilometer on AlGaAs etch

The deep AlGaAs wet etch for the mesas was done for 1 minute and 15 seconds on the dummy which gave 3000 - 3400 nm of etch depth, and thus the time was increased to 1 minute and 30 seconds for the LED, which gave 3100 - 3500 nm of etch depth. 
The deviation in etch depth is illustrated in \autoref{fig:profilometer_AlGaAs_3500nm_etch}, where the devitaion is due to the fact that the profilometer data is not flat before and after the mesas. 
The etch rate was around 40 nm/s.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{figures/LED_AlGaAs_3100nm_etch.png}
    \caption{
        Profilometer data plot after the mesa etch of the LED sample.
        The etch is 3500 nm deep at the edges of the mesas, but the profile is not flat before and after each mesa. 
        The data points outside the mesas flattened at 400 nm, which puts the etch depth between 3100 and 3500 nm.
        The height of the fingers are around 3840 nm, because of the GaAs layer and Au fingers on top of the AlGaAs.

\subsection{PECVD}

The result of the PECVD of Si$_3$N$_4$ was inspected using an ellipsometer.
From this, the reflectance as a function of wavelength was obtained, as can be seen in \autoref{fig:pecvd_ellipsometer}.
The goodness of fit was 0.9926.
The lowest measured reflectance was 0.29 \% at 667.7 nm. 
At a wavelength of 675 nm, the reflectance was 0.42 \%.
From the ellipsometer, the thickness of the Si$_3$N$_4$ layer was measured to be 249.70 nm.
From \autoref{eq:thickness}, with a refractive index $n$ of 2.02 at $\lambda \approx$ 670 nm \cite{ref_index_Si3N4}, the thickness is calculated to be 247.91 nm. 
These results are summarized in \autoref{tab:pecvd_ellipsometer}.

\subsection{Optical Characterization of PECVD}

After the PECVD and its finishing steps, an 10X optical image was taken of the LED.
This image can be seen in \autoref{fig:led_optical}.
From this, it can clearly be seen that the Si$_3$N$_4$ film is not uniform.
Visually, it seems that the film has cracked and that there are some impurities present.

\subsection{Final Optical Inspection}

Using an optical microscope, the final LED sample was inspected.
\autoref{fig:best_led} shows the visually best LED, which has an 80 \textmu m period and a 4 \textmu m finger width.
\autoref{fig:worst_led} shows the visually worst LED, which has a 40 \textmu m period and a 16 \textmu m finger width.

A final 50X magnification optical image were taken of all four alignment marks.
The result can be seen in \autoref{fig:align_marks}.
From these pictures, it is not possible to give a numerical estimate on the alignment accuracy
